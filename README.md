# Tauri + React + Typescript

This template should help get you started developing with Tauri, React and Typescript in Vite.

## Information

This project is a fork of the [Labyrinthine Cosmetic Utility](https://github.com/TiagoRibeiro25/electron-labyrinthine-cosmetics-utility) made in Electron, but now using Tauri. By using Tauri, we were able to reduce the size of the application from 75mb to 25mb, the memory usage went from 120mb to 5mb and lower resource usage in general.
